Hi! I'm a Machine Learning Developer at [StratumAI](https://www.stratum.ai/). Previously, I was a research intern at the [Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence](https://vectorinstitute.ai/), where I worked with [Alireza Makhzani](http://www.alireza.ai/), [Leonid Sigal](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~lsigal/), and [Sageev Oore](https://www.cs.smu.ca/~sageev/). 

I received my BASc in [Engineering Science](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/program/what-is-engsci/) with Honours from the University of Toronto, where I specialized in [Machine Intelligence](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/program/majors/machine-intelligence/). I'm also excited to announce that I will be starting my PhD in Computer Science at Georgia Tech in Fall 2022!

Research Interests 
======

My interests lie in **machine learning**. My goal is to build models capable of understanding the multi-modal world, particularly vision and audio, and synthesizing it in digital form. 

Topics I am currently exploring are:  

* Generative models 
* Representation learning
* Video understanding
* Multi-modal learning (focus on vision and audio)
